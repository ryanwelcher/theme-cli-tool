# theme-cli-tool

This is a proof of concept for a block theme CLI tool

## Usage

`node ./index.js <theme-slug>`

Available options:

- `--author-name <name>`
- `--child-of <theme-slug>`
- `--template <name>`

## Testing

Run the following from the root of this directory:

`node ./index.js my-test-theme`

Confirm that a theme is scaffolded in a `my-test-theme` directory.
